detect_text_bias_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the provided textual data for potential bias, subjectivity, or unfair framing.
    
    IMPORTANT: DO NOT MODIFY the original text. Your job is to assess and highlight problematic patterns.
    
    You must:
    
    1. Parse the input text or list of texts (e.g., from previous task or input)
    2. Identify language that may suggest bias â€” such as overly positive/negative framing, emotionally charged words, stereotypes, or imbalance in representation
    3. For each text, determine:
       - Whether bias is present (Yes/No)
       - If yes, provide a short explanation of the bias detected
    4. Use concise, neutral language in your explanations
    5. Output each result on a new line, in the following format:
       Bias Detected: <Yes/No>  
       Explanation: <Short explanation or "N/A">
    
    REMINDER: Do not attempt to rewrite or fix the text. Focus only on detection and explanation.

  expected_output: >
    Structured response indicating whether bias was detected and why, e.g.:

    Bias Detected: Yes  
    Explanation: The text favors one demographic group while discrediting another without justification
